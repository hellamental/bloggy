<h1>Nope, nothing from me...</h1>

I don't know what this is supposed to be...thoughts and prayers, half hatched ideas.

There is chaos inside. A violence, restless anger. Taking up all of the space, yet it is completely silent. There is no inner monologue converting anything into words. No noise. Which makes it very difficult to bring words out. 
To think, and then struggle to translate it to the words i can bring out to communicate to others. 

Not an original thought I'm sure. Everything has been done before...
Maybe I should go and read some stoic blog entry from the greats of history. 

Otherwise i'll just use this as a project board
try a couple things, fail a bit, try some more. 

noise for noise's sake
